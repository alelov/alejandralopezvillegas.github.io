	<p>I am a Ph.D Student in Political Science at Michigan State University (MSU). Broadly speaking, my research examines democratic backsliding, gender dynamics, and the intersection between the two. More specifically, I look into how elite dynamics within the ruling party can enable democratic backsliding, and why anti-democratic leaders harm women's rights. While I have regional expertise in Latin America, I have a broad interest in examining democratic backsliding and gender dynamics elsewhere, including in Africa and Eastern Europe. Methodologically, I focus on quantitative approaches to research methods, such as Time Series Cross Section Analysis, survey experiments, and hierarchical linear modeling.</p>
	<p>Prior to being a doctoral student at MSU, I completed my B.A. in International Relations at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) and an M.A. in International Development at Sciences Po Paris.</p>
